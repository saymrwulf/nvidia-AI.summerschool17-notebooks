WHETHER THIS PROPENSITY BE ONE OF THOSE ORIGINAL PRINCIPLES IN HUMAN
NATURE, OF WHICH NO FURTHER ACCOUNT CAN BE GIVEN, OR WHETHER, AS SEEMS
MORE PROBABLE, IT BE THE NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE OF THE FACULTIES OF
REASON AND SPEECH, IT BELONGS NOT TO OUR PRESENT SUBJECT TO INQUIRE. IT
IS COMMON TO ALL MEN, AND TO BE FOUND IN NO OTHER RACE OF ANIMALS,
WHICH SEEM TO KNOW NEITHER THIS NOR ANY OTHER SPECIES OF CONTRACTS. TWO
GREYHOUNDS, IN RUNNING DOWN THE SAME HARE, HAVE SOMETIMES THE APPEARANCE
OF ACTING IN SOME SORT OF CONCERT. EACH TURNS HER TOWARDS HIS COMPANION,
OR ENDEAVOURS TO INTERCEPT HER WHEN HIS COMPANION TURNS HER TOWARDS
HIMSELF. THIS, HOWEVER, IS NOT THE EFFECT OF ANY CONTRACT, BUT OF THE
ACCIDENTAL CONCURRENCE OF THEIR PASSIONS IN THE SAME OBJECT AT THAT
PARTICULAR TIME. NOBODY EVER SAW A DOG MAKE A FAIR AND DELIBERATE
EXCHANGE OF ONE BONE FOR ANOTHER WITH ANOTHER DOG. NOBODY EVER SAW ONE
ANIMAL, BY ITS GESTURES AND NATURAL CRIES SIGNIFY TO ANOTHER, THIS IS
MINE, THAT YOURS; I AM WILLING TO GIVE THIS FOR THAT. WHEN AN ANIMAL
WANTS TO OBTAIN SOMETHING EITHER OF A MAN, OR OF ANOTHER ANIMAL, IT
HAS NO OTHER MEANS OF PERSUASION, BUT TO GAIN THE FAVOUR OF THOSE
WHOSE SERVICE IT REQUIRES. A PUPPY FAWNS UPON ITS DAM, AND A SPANIEL
ENDEAVOURS, BY A THOUSAND ATTRACTIONS, TO ENGAGE THE ATTENTION OF ITS
MASTER WHO IS AT DINNER, WHEN IT WANTS TO BE FED BY HIM. MAN SOMETIMES
USES THE SAME ARTS WITH HIS BRETHREN, AND WHEN HE HAS NO OTHER MEANS OF
ENGAGING THEM TO ACT ACCORDING TO HIS INCLINATIONS, ENDEAVOURS BY EVERY
SERVILE AND FAWNING ATTENTION TO OBTAIN THEIR GOOD WILL. HE HAS NOT
TIME, HOWEVER, TO DO THIS UPON EVERY OCCASION. IN CIVILIZED SOCIETY HE
STANDS AT ALL TIMES IN NEED OF THE CO-OPERATION AND ASSISTANCE OF
GREAT MULTITUDES, WHILE HIS WHOLE LIFE IS SCARCE SUFFICIENT TO GAIN THE
FRIENDSHIP OF A FEW PERSONS. IN ALMOST EVERY OTHER RACE OF ANIMALS, EACH
INDIVIDUAL, WHEN IT IS GROWN UP TO MATURITY, IS ENTIRELY INDEPENDENT,
AND IN ITS NATURAL STATE HAS OCCASION FOR THE ASSISTANCE OF NO OTHER
LIVING CREATURE. BUT MAN HAS ALMOST CONSTANT OCCASION FOR THE HELP
OF HIS BRETHREN, AND IT IS IN VAIN FOR HIM TO EXPECT IT FROM THEIR
BENEVOLENCE ONLY. HE WILL BE MORE LIKELY TO PREVAIL IF HE CAN INTEREST
THEIR SELF-LOVE IN HIS FAVOUR, AND SHEW THEM THAT IT IS FOR THEIR OWN
ADVANTAGE TO DO FOR HIM WHAT HE REQUIRES OF THEM. WHOEVER OFFERS TO
ANOTHER A BARGAIN OF ANY KIND, PROPOSES TO DO THIS. GIVE ME THAT WHICH
I WANT, AND YOU SHALL HAVE THIS WHICH YOU WANT, IS THE MEANING OF EVERY
SUCH OFFER; AND IT IS IN THIS MANNER THAT WE OBTAIN FROM ONE ANOTHER THE
FAR GREATER PART OF THOSE GOOD OFFICES WHICH WE STAND IN NEED OF. IT IS
NOT FROM THE BENEVOLENCE OF THE BUTCHER, THE BREWER, OR THE BAKER THAT
WE EXPECT OUR DINNER, BUT FROM THEIR REGARD TO THEIR OWN INTEREST. WE
ADDRESS OURSELVES, NOT TO THEIR HUMANITY, BUT TO THEIR SELF-LOVE, AND
NEVER TALK TO THEM OF OUR OWN NECESSITIES, BUT OF THEIR ADVANTAGES.
NOBODY BUT A BEGGAR CHOOSES TO DEPEND CHIEFLY UPON THE BENEVOLENCE OF
HIS FELLOW-CITIZENS. EVEN A BEGGAR DOES NOT DEPEND UPON IT ENTIRELY.
THE CHARITY OF WELL-DISPOSED PEOPLE, INDEED, SUPPLIES HIM WITH THE WHOLE
FUND OF HIS SUBSISTENCE. BUT THOUGH THIS PRINCIPLE ULTIMATELY PROVIDES
HIM WITH ALL THE NECESSARIES OF LIFE WHICH HE HAS OCCASION FOR, IT
NEITHER DOES NOR CAN PROVIDE HIM WITH THEM AS HE HAS OCCASION FOR THEM.
THE GREATER PART OF HIS OCCASIONAL WANTS ARE SUPPLIED IN THE SAME MANNER
AS THOSE OF OTHER PEOPLE, BY TREATY, BY BARTER, AND BY PURCHASE. WITH
THE MONEY WHICH ONE MAN GIVES HIM HE PURCHASES FOOD. THE OLD CLOTHES
WHICH ANOTHER BESTOWS UPON HIM HE EXCHANGES FOR OTHER CLOTHES WHICH SUIT
HIM BETTER, OR FOR LODGING, OR FOR FOOD, OR FOR MONEY, WITH WHICH HE CAN
BUY EITHER FOOD, CLOTHES, OR LODGING, AS HE HAS OCCASION.
